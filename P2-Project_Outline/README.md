### Overview
Include overview here
My app is for social workers who are required to visit multiple clients every three months. 
After a user enters in their client's name and the last time they visited, the app determines and reminds the user the next availible visit date. 
I want my app to solve the problem of mangaing many clients and provide some sort of organization. The idea came from conversing with my cousin who works as a
care cocordinator and visits many clients in the memphis area. 

### Features
Include Features here
Users will be able to add/edit clients' names and last visitations. 
Main feature will be that the app determines the next visitation date based on three months. 
Another feature is a way to notify or remind the user when a future visit is comming up or late through the UI.
I also want to implement user login so the different users can keep track of their own clients. 

### Technologies
Include Technologies here
I want to use Java language with a database. I also think using javascript with HTML/CSS will be helpful as well for the notification feature. 

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here
Javascript 
I will have to learn with java how to calculate the next date time with the user's previous visit date.
